Take Home Project by Krikey

As a part of the take home project provided to me, I have done the following steps:

1. Answers_part1.sql file contains a sql code that creates a sample MySQL Database along with insert queries on your localhost. The sql file also contains the answers to the three questions.
2. To build the api endpoint for the fetching the data from the localhost in JSON format and display on the browser, unzip the Krikey_TakeHome.zip file.
3. The 'config.py', represents a flask application that creates multiple api endpoints to fetch the data from the localhost database and display it in the JSON format. Machine-heavy queries have also been cached to improve performance incase the database is large
4. Finally a 'DockerFile' is created that creates a docker image of the flask application on your personal computer. It depends on requirements.txt file to install the dependencies required by the flask application.
5. Thank you.
